/More details to come! :)/

** Description
This mode is to support "tag", annotation in org-files or comments in programming mode.
A tags looks like a java annotation with =§= (primary) or =¤= (secondary) instead of the =@=.

The emacs mode currently support highlighting and basic navigation between these tags.

# §todo: example of the current syntax:

** Installation

To install it, put the files in your load path, and require it.
Otherwise, if you use [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] you could use the following config
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package omni-tags
    :init (progn
            (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'omni-tags-mode)
            (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'omni-tags-mode)))

#+end_src


Wait it to mature a bit and you might get =some el-get= recipe, before it hits elpa, melpa, quelpa or else.

** Usage

Once mode is on in the current buffer, you see specific syntax highlighting.
You can also navigate between them using =omni-tags-next-tags= and =omni-tags-previous-tags= respectively bound to =M-§= and =C-§=
There is also =omni-tags-occur-tags= that run =occur= targetting tags which is bound by default to =C-M-§=

# add blabla about C-u combos

** Configuration

To customize character used as tags symbol, just run =M-x customization-group RET omni-tags=.
The faces are also customizables, in =omni-tags-face=

** Notes

This is still a prototype. So if ever you think about using it, prefer the =master= branch, and expect to update your config.

It's working, I use it on my =Emacs=, but it's far wrong being perfect and not yet stable.
(Cask config to be improved.)

*If you have any remark, refactor suggestion or else, just pose an issue ;)*

*Important*: i'm starting to rename it with annotation or something to avoid the confusion about programming tags. (there are closer to twitter tags)
